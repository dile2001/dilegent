              With over two decades of diverse international experience spanning four countries and numerous cross-cultural organizations, I've embarked on an exhilarating journey in the world of software development.

<br /> <br />It all began back in 2000 during my final years at university, where I first dipped my toes into the waters of object-orientation with C#. From there, my path led me through the realms of Foxpro, Visual Basic, PHP, and eventually Asp.net. In 2012, I embraced the power of JavaScript, a language that has since become my trusted companion in the ever-evolving landscape of web development. In 2020, I took the plunge into the exciting worlds of React and Redux, enriching my toolkit and broadening my horizons.

              Presently, I serve as a Front-end Developer at Emirates Airlines, where I blend my passion for technology with my love for travel. My role involves leveraging my expertise in JavaScript, React, Redux, and Node.js to drive the modernization of their web applications.

<br />My contributions not only empower the Emirates team to deliver high-quality, maintainable products but also infuse an element of enjoyment into the work environment, creating a synergy between innovation and excitement.
